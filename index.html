  <p>​Imagine being uprooted from your home, instructed to take only what you could carrry......and an ordinary individual stopped in to try to understand....</p>
      <p>While many Japanese American families endured profound losses with no one to turn to, 
        some were extended a helping hand or kind favor by a non-Nikkei individual - a friend, a neighbor, a teacher, a stranger - 
        who stood up to help when our families and communities were being forcibly uprooted and being removed from the West Coast.
        These individuals did things like rented out our farms to pay the land taxes, maintained ways for us to return to something
        of our businesses and homes, or faithfully extended a kindness when our families were being quickly corralled away.
