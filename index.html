  <p>​Imagine being uprooted from your home, instructed to take only what you could carrry......and an ordinary individual stopped in to try to understand....</p>
  <p>While many Japanese American families endured profound losses with no one to turn to, some were extended a helping hand or kind favor by a non-Nikkei individual - a friend, a neighbor, a teacher, a stranger - who stood up to help when our families and communities were being forcibly uprooted and being removed from the West Coast. These individuals did things like rented out our farms to pay the land taxes, maintained ways for us to return to something of our businesses and homes, or faithfully extended a kindness when our families were being quickly corralled away.</p>
<p>These individuals did things like rented out our farms to pay the land taxes, maintained ways for us to return to something of our homes and businesses, or faithfully extended a kindness while our families were being quickly corralled away. These people could not prevent the mass incarceration, but their acts of help, large and small, made an immeasurable difference for Japanese American generations to come. They showed up despite their own surveillance by the FBI, and despite taunts by their own neighbors of being traitors themselves. Some could not publicly show up, but found a way behind the scenes to come forth to help, or to give a Nikkei family a quick break hoping no one was looking. They acted. <strong>Helpers are healers.</strong></p>
<p>Generations later, these personal stories of help and empathy offer a different kind of healing. Beyond the narratives of hardship, they illuminate instances of decency and fairness that emerged from a period of profound injustice.  For descendants of the early Issei and Nisei, these accounts heal intergenerational wounds from racial division stoked during a dark chapter of American history.</p><p><strong>For those of non-Japanese American heritage,</strong> these stories awaken pride in acts of decency and fairness that came from their own communities, inviting curiosity into our full American history. For all of us, these stories are the lessons from history that teach us who we can be in our present times.</p>         
<p><strong>Our goal </strong>is to gather these "helper" memories -  stories of assistence and compassion from ordinary individuals towards Japanese Americans during the WWII racial hysteria, evacuation from the West Coast, and mass incarceration. We also welcome helper narratives about Nikkei outside of the West Coast who were under intense restrictions while not being incarcerated.  We plan to use these stories to honor those of non-Japanese heritage who stepped forward against the tide of racism, to enhance conversation about personal conviction, and to encourage similar helper actions when an injustice is being done to another person.  We intend to make the collected stories available in different forms at Japanese American confinement sites, museums, and displays, and available to others in a not-for-profit archive, with lengthier story versions include<p>Initially we plan for museum-length shorter versions, but lengthier versions of stories are welcome in planning for an adjunct repository for public access.</p>d there. or in print publication.​​​​</p>

    <h2>Sending your story: Guidelines</h2>       
    <p>The suggested written length is from a paragraph to one page, possibly two, with copies of photos, artwork, or documents that aid the narratives.If you need someone to talk to about writing it down or recording it, please contact us.</p> 
    <p>Initially we plan for museum-length shorter versions, but lengthier versions of stories are welcome in planning for an adjunct repository for public access.</p>
    <p>We may request to do some light editing for clarity. These personal stories will not be publicly released without your written permission. As we believe this to be a first call specifically for helper histories, we aim to seek funding or donations in 2025 and beyond. We hope to gather an initial round of stories by October 31, 2025 for inclusion in a first collection. Stories submitted after that date will still be welcomed as the project expects to be an ongoing one.<p/>

An unforgettable debt of gratitude.This Japanese phrase hints that "the debt of gratitude for someone's kindness or favor is so deep that it cannot be forgotten even if you want to. There is a moral obligation attached to not forgetting - that you must remember and be indebted for one's lifetime in the context of relationships in the family, village, work company." (Emy and Yasuo Kamihara of Montclair, NJ).</p><br>
  <p><strong>About the Organizers:</strong></p>
<p>Sandra Buscher is a great person who lives in Connecticut. (She needs to add here​)....</p>
<p>Margret Mukai is a retired nurse based in Philadelphia. During WWII internment h1er grandparents were able to return to their farm in Spring Valley, CA because their neighbors rented it out and paid its property taxes without profiting themselves. Her mother, Kyoko Hoshiga, a musician who was working at the Mills College library at the time of Pearl Harbor, directed the Tanforan Assembly Center Library, cataloguing 4,000 books donated by Bay Area libraries. The donation efforts were spearheaded by Mills librarian Evelyn Steele Little who despite repeated trips to Tanforan, was seldom permitted entry to help. The books were packed and shipped to Utah to become the foundation of the Topaz Library.</p>
<p>Arlin Ortiz generously contributed his software development skills for this website. He is a Los Angeles-based artist who needs to finish this profile.....</p>
<p>Our thanks to Emy and Yasuo Kamihara of Montclair, NJ, for their thoughtful insights into the Japanese concepts of gratitude and thankfulness.</p>
